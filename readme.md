#Easy ML

Easy ML is a Python library for simplifying the version control, optimization, and deployment of machine learning models. It provides an easy-to-use interface for training and evaluating models, and includes features for data saving, progress tracking, and hyperparameter tuning.
Features

    Simple interface for creating and training machine learning models
    Easy data saving and loading for reproducibility
    Progress tracking for monitoring model performance
    Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model accuracy
    Customizable model naming conventions for easy organization

Installation

Easy ML can be installed using pip:

pip install easyml

Getting Started

To get started with Easy ML, import the EasyML class from the easyml package:

python

from easyml import EasyML

# Create a new EasyML object
model = EasyML()

# Load your data
X, y = ...

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y)

# Evaluate the model
score = model.score(X, y)
print(f"Accuracy: {score}")

This will create a new Easy ML model, train it on the provided data, and evaluate its accuracy. The EasyML class provides many other methods for saving data, tuning hyperparameters, and tracking progress. For more information, see the documentation at [LINK TO DOCUMENTATION HERE].
